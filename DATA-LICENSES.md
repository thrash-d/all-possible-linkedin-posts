The word data is different. `lexicon.json`, and the copy of it embedded in `linkedin-posts-standalone.html` inside the `<script id="lexicon-data">` block, is derived from the sources listed here. Because it includes data adapted from wordfreq, which is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0, the word data is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). If you share or adapt it, keep this file with it and use the same license.

## Princeton WordNet 3.0

The vocabulary, parts of speech, and the `concrete` flag come from WordNet 3.0, accessed through the NLTK `wordnet` corpus. The WordNet license requires the following notice on all copies of the database, including modified copies:

> WordNet Release 3.0 This software and database is being provided to you, the LICENSEE, by Princeton University under the following license.

Changes: kept single-word lemmas made of ASCII letters, hyphens, and apostrophes. Dropped multiword entries and lemmas under the frequency floor. Moved capitalized-only lemmas to a separate proper-noun list.

## `wordfreq`

Word frequencies come from [wordfreq](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq) by Robyn Speer. The wordfreq code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, and its data files are licensed under [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). The wordfreq code isn't included here.

Citation: Robyn Speer. (2022). rspeer/wordfreq: v3.0 (v3.0.2). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7199437

Changes: looked up the English Zipf frequency of each WordNet lemma, kept lemmas at 2.5 or higher, and stored the value rounded to one decimal place in the `zipf` column.

wordfreq's own data sources carry these attributions, which pass through to derived data:

- SUBTLEX word lists (SUBTLEX-US, SUBTLEX-UK, and others) by Marc Brysbaert et al., distributed in wordfreq with the author's permission. SUBTLEX is freely available data: http://crr.ugent.be/programs-data/subtitle-frequencies
- Google Books Ngram Viewer: http://books.google.com/ngrams
- OPUS OpenSubtitles 2018, originating from the OpenSubtitles project: http://www.opensubtitles.org/
- The Leeds Internet Corpus (University of Leeds Centre for Translation Studies), Wikipedia, and ParaCrawl, under Creative Commons licenses.

## LemmInflect and the SPECIALIST Lexicon

Plural and verb forms were generated with [LemmInflect](https://github.com/bjascob/LemmInflect) by Brad Jascob (MIT License, copyright 2019 Brad Jascob). LemmInflect's dictionary and morphology rules are derived from the [SPECIALIST Lexicon](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Projects/lexicon/current/web/index.html) of the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, National Library of Medicine. LemmInflect doesn't state which SPECIALIST Lexicon release it uses.

The SPECIALIST NLP Tools are a United States Government product. The United States Government, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine, Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, and their agencies, contractors, subcontractors, and employees make no warranties, expressed or implied, with respect to the SPECIALIST NLP Tools, and assume no liability for any party's use, or the results of such use, of any part of these tools. Those names may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from the tools without specific prior written permission. Full terms: [Terms and Conditions for Use of the SPECIALIST NLP Tools](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LSG/Docs/termsAndConditions.html).

Changes: stored one inflected form per tag (`NNS`, `VBZ`, `VBD`, `VBG`, `VBN`) for each lemma, falling back to the lemma when LemmInflect returns nothing.

## CMU Pronouncing Dictionary

Syllable counts come from the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict), read through [pronouncing](https://github.com/aparrish/pronouncingpy) by Allison Parrish (BSD license). Only the syllable counts are included, not the pronunciations.

Changes: reduced each word's first listed pronunciation to a syllable count. Hyphenated words are the sum of their parts.

## spaCy `en_core_web_md`

The `corp` scores and theme word lists were computed from the word vectors in [en_core_web_md](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_md) by [Explosion](https://explosion.ai), released under the MIT License. Its vectors are Explosion Vectors trained on OSCAR 2109, Wikipedia, OpenSubtitles, and WMT News Crawl. The vectors themselves aren't included. Only derived similarity scores (0 to 100) and nearest-word indexes are.

## Build-time tools

[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) (Apache License 2.0), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (BSD license), and [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) (MIT License) run during the build. None of their code is included in this repo.
